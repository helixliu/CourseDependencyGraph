Course Dependency Graph
=====================
Demo: http://rayedchancdg.weebly.com/  
Course dependency graph of an academic major. This project uses ArborJS to build and display a dependency graph. Useful information can be obtained from dependency graph like course prerequisites, minimum number of semesters to complete a major (longest path), courses that are ready to be taken given completed courses, course scheduling, to name a few.

Implementation
=====================
Data Storage: Each academic major is stored in a separate JSON file.  
Data Representation: The data within a JSON file represents a hash map. The key is a String type and course id is used as the key field since it is unique. The value of the hash map holds an object with the following properties {Name = The name of the course, Prerequisites = A list of course names to be completed before taking this course}.
Description: The particle system starts with the courses with no prerequisites. Each course node in the system has a state as represented by a color (Grey = Unavailable, Blue = Ready to take, Green = Completed, Unknown = Not seen yet). A course can only be marked completed (Green state) if all the prerequisites are fulfilled (It is implied that the current node is ready be taken (blue state)). Once a course is completed, more course nodes may become avaliable or discovered. A course is marked ready to be taken (blue state) if all the prerequisites are completed. A course node is marked unavailable (Grey color) if the node has been seen (at least one prerequisite was completed). Inbound edges represents the course node's prerequisites. Undo of completed course node if and only if there are not outbound edges to another completed course node. Yellow edges represents "OR prerequisites".  

Bugs
=====================
-Single node in Particle System crashes code (ArborJS)  
-Does not work for IE9 (ArborJS)  
-Event trigger buttons fail to work if Particle System freezes  

My Suggestion for Improvements
=====================
-Add functionality to handle corequisite  
-Redesign algorithm and json data structure to handle complex course prerequisite  
+ Example Scenario: (C1 && (C2 || (C3 && C4)) || (C5 && C6)  
+ Example JSON Representation: OR:[[C1,OR:[C2,[C3,C4]]],[C5,C6]]  

-Handle overlapping (equivalent) courses
